<p>Can you hear me now?…Learning a programming language is interesting and fun at the same time, even more if you like to work with data. Unfortunately, it tends to fall into the erroneous idea that programming is only for those with a background in computing science and/or engineering, nevertheless, I think that programming is a multidisciplinary skill, where the only limitations are your own ideas.</p>
<p>Hi! My name is Gabriel Cabrera and this is my little corner in this chaotic world. I am an enthusiastic of Programming and how Data can tell stories and prepare us to understand the real world. I am aware that without new technologies, that allow us to work with tons of information, none of this would be possible. Fun fact: by the year 2025, it is expected that the World’s Data hits 163 Zettabytes, cool huh? I mostly work in R, due to its massive number of libraries. I learn python and julia every day :).</p>

<p>When I’m not in front of my desktop or laptop, I’ll probably be reading science fiction comics, watching movies, of all kind, and YouTube videos, lately Stand-up comedy.</p>

<p>To wrap this up, I got a B.A in Economics at University of Chile and Msc in Finance (c) at the same university. If you want to get to know me a little bit more, you can download my complete <a href="/pdf/rmarkdown-cv.pdf">C.V</a>.</p>
